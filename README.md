# Quantum Cicruit of Modular Exponentiation in Qiskit
We are constructing a circuit for Modular Exponentiation in Qiskit.

This is based on the paper ["Quantum Networks for Elementary Arithmetic Operations"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9511018.pdf) by Vlatko Vedral, Adriano Barenco and Artur Ekert in this circuit. 

>We assume that $gcd(a,N)=1$ which is not mentioned in the paper. However, this is infact necessary to preserve the unitarity of certain operations that we perform.
